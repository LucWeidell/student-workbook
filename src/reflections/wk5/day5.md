# End of Week 5 (Day 5/5)

## Reflection of Week 5: Node Document Db
This week completes the beginning of the back end. I followed pretty well except a little bit
for how Auth0 exactly works. Granted this is the driving versus knowing the engine, but
at this level I hope to still be able to understand the engine.
Improvements can be made on the hackathon
Also my understanding of many to many interactions for the intermediary classes is a little weak.
I understand the use case just the placement is a little confusing.
