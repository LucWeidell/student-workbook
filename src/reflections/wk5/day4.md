# AUTH (Day 4/5)

## What is a virtual property?
Additional fields for a model that are not explicitly defined.

## When might you use a virtual property?
Common use case for us is timestamps with toJSON. This adds all timestamps, and custom
id values without having to define some fields again such as id, or timestamps.

## How do you search by a virtual properties value?
To search by a virtual propertuy required the function at the bottom of the model on
"model".virtuals. With the fields such as local field / reference.

## Afternoon project:
Trello, Lucid, and Figma made for the hackathon
