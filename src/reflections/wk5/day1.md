# INTRO TO NODEJS (Day 1/5)

## What is the purpose of a Query String?
Query String is used for getter to return specific data, or amount of data.
Limits, searches, tags , ect.

## What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?
The Query in the url starts with a ?, and is distinguished with symbols such as & when the api is read.

## When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?
For all getters: limit response and can do user defined searches.
