## Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.
Concerns:
  Just honestly need to stay focused and work for functionality first before concerns over appearance
Manage My time:
  Plan on working on Front end to populate properly a but and then full backend
  I drew out everything needed and stubbed accordingly, just need to follow through
Most about the couse:
  Honestly just the practical work the balance of lecture to projects keeps the interest high.
