# End of Week 9

## Reflection:
I am tired so I will leave this short for this week, but it was a tiring week. Acting both as a PO
but also trying to get a product out that I think was going to be worthy to be seen by others.
I think there is still tinkering that needs to be done but as the second capstone I have done: one being 8 months and this being 2
weeks. This was a heck of a crunch.
