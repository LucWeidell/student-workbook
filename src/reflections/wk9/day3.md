## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?
Simply: Communication, scale, development time, management, ect. Everything changes the more member there are.
Its more people that need to be kept in the loop and monitored but can have the effect of faster/ more ambitious development time.

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.
Sprints are supposed to be pre-defined lengths of time where the objective is to complete the following to a DoD state.
When taking on the sprint tasks the assumption is to Complete them. Thus is makes no sense to take on multiple sprints at
once since a single sprint is by definition supposed to require the teams full focus.

## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?
Simply: Perfect code and testing/ no degugging, Perfect deign and communication, And Super fast Development time,
Are 3 elements that cannot be achieved all at once. When one is perfect the other fall of. Super fast development time,
for example, losses on code design and more debugging than hoped, aka cheap code.
