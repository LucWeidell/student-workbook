# CAPSTONES

## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
Agile Sprint, Encapsulation, cRUDE, SOLID, gihub, observers, GitHub, and more.
While we want to focus on these more, the development timr is short so hitting MVP is critical.

## What went well so far?
Biggest well so fars are we have expertly navigated away from most major roadbloacks, and communication is flowing well.
As the PO: the team dynmics are fine, the pace of development is a little lower than hoped, but it is a
0 strike checkpoint so no pressure. I need to control the discussion times a bit better, but I feel
the communication of the direction is always maintained which is critical.

## What would you do differently? Why?
Differently I already described above but it would be: up the teams development speed + and give more
solid opinions on the direction without compromising the groups positive dynamics. Why: becasuse our pace
is lacking for MVPs.
