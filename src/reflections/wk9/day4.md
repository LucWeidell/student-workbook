## What is an SSL certificate?
A secure socket layer. Small files that create a key encrypted relationship between the server and the client.

## What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?
Extended Validation: used to show the legitimacy of your domain from the address bar
Organization Validated: proves  your organization and domain validation are real
Domain Validated: quickest validation you can receive: shows as a green padlock
Wildcard: when you buy the certificate for a domain, can be used for subdomains as well
Unified Communications: allow multiple domain names to be on the same certificate

## What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?
The biggest reasoning for SSLs is to protect you clients data and privacy. This also
legitimizes your website so when a user goes to Apple.com they can confirm with the CA and SSL
that they have navigated to the proper website versus a scammer/fake site.
