# Review of HTML/CSS (Day 2)

## What I learned in coding school is ....
This was a nice review of html and CSS. Good explanation of building from scratch a functioning webpage. Nice evnviromental setup using bcw-serve makes running local easy.

## What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
A pseudo class is triggered during a specific event in oder to gernerate some sort of change. For example you may have a hover class, onclick, hold, double click, etc. These are not permanent classes (i mean they are always checking but not in use) and can be given to many different elements.

## What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
Specificity can be good for target a very strong for targeting a singular element or all childrent of an element. And this can be used to orange over-rides for lower values of importance.
Ex: hiting C on the page opens up a pic of a cat which is above the background, since the cats image layer is higher in the heigharchy.(a child of the body for ex)

## What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
If you use !important but you are using a heirachy it breaks all those rules. So first it can be extremely hard to find sometimes that the issue is the important if you are much deeper in a repository or a style is importanted so your new style isnt working because it can over-ride the important one. Its cumbersome and 99% of the time there is an actually solution you are being lazy about.
