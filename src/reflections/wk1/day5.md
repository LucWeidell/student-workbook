# Reflection week1 (HTML + CSS)

## This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

This to improve later resources:
Udemy HTML for fancyFont and forms and such.
Udemy on boostrap

Projects:
Reflect back on Stoplight:
Reflect on the checkpoint to add css animations
Look at Figma and wireframing later.

My reflection:
I started using vh and then was overusing w/ not enough bootstrap. I then got really good with bootstrap
but apprently at this checkpoint was overusing it a but. Was complimented for my design so think im on a good track. Biggest focus going forward is just always getting that understanding of the tool or method and applying as mch as possible. Getting out of my comfort zone to learn.
