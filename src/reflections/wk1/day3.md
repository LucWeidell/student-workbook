# Building with Bootcamp (day 3)

## Reflection:
Definetly an imporvement from no html builder. Good reduction of code and much simpler element placement for aligmnet and centering.

## What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
There are some very foudamental tips int here about design in general. A good one I never really actively though about but is a good idea is when dealing with mutiple box-styled elements neer each other using seperating colors is a good way to make a more themed but still pleasant view for the view.

## Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
If im reviewing to see if something is good design: checklist:
-Spacing: nothing cramped or touching edges or colliding with other content
-Alignment: Is is strucured in any meaningful way or did they just throw btton at a wall
-Content: Is the info bite-sized or did someone just past a wikapedia page for a home screen
-Color/Fonts for Text: Is all the text reable
Color for space: Is there a theme or is it just painful to look at the combination of colors: or too bland
.....
There are more specifics for each element but broadly looking at a page this can give you a good start.

## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
Good deign:
-fascilitates traffic of users since it should be customer centered: make the shopping process easy for example
-Hand sized content means viewers may actually consume and retain information you want to convey
-Better design/viewing comfort: keeps viewers on the page longer: meaning more interest, leading to increased odds of customer returns/recommendation/purchase.
There are many ways and a bad design shows unprofessionalism meaning that the products intrinsic value drops for the customer. Bad website means possibly bad customer support for example.
