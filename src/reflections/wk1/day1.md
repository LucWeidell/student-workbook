# Intro to Codeworks (Day1)

## What I learned in coding school is ....
that seeting up enviroments is a pain.
Nothing new just always fun how difficult it is to integrate developer applications.

## In your own words, why do we use Git?
Extreamly powerful tool for merging directories: and created seperate working branches that can be merged later. Multiple people working on code without one persons mistake bringing everyones local (except when they break master .....ðŸ˜ ). Also terminal friendsly: multi system friendly, and low latency in pulling.

## What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
Muliple teams of developers or individuals can build a modular system on stable builds of main and then when commiting make sure the build is stabke then update main without compromising other people content. So great for security, QA, artifact building, and simultaneus pushes

## What is the difference between Git and GitHub
Git it a loca repository existing on the hosts system or server. Github the online repository that stores the final pushed copy to main or any other branches pushed to the online system.
