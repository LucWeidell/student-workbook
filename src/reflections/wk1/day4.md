# Wire-framing and Design Tools (FIGMA) (Day 4)

## Relction:
Have done some Wire-framing with draw-io in the past but like figma's deign process. Want to look at later: gives high level of ui-ux.

## What is the purpose of wire-framing?
Wireframing is a cheap, efficient way of getting a user-focused design mock-up for a website that can be at mutiple levels depending on the need.
Also very good for iterating and are simple sketches for usage to design function interfaces for the user.

## What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
Low: Low fidelity is great to get a good structure for the disign without wasting time styling. ITs about getting the necessary content on the page and determinging whats dnecessary. Plus is more programatic including tags to easly transfer to the development file.
Medium:Bridge between low and high, may have some basic styles: styling positioning, and reduce some of the low fidelity laguage but still more a developer tool. And less non-technical firendly.
High: Figma- Great for developing a prefossional mockup. Great for presentations, demonstrations, startup mvc presentations and ui-ux view since mobile translation is easy. Team sharable too.

## Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
Almost ALWAYS!
From experience almost everything you code will have bee wireframed or block-diagramed at some point. Critical for styling and documentation, but also for designing the functional code behind the browser. What functionality is needed, the disign of the code, mcv, hard corded, ext.
If you have a little time t pays off when you start structuring the priject files.
