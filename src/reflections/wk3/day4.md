# WORKING IN MVC WITH COMPLEX DATA, ARRAY METHODS (day 4/3)


## What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
Hopes to solve the issue of code duplications when an event is triggered. The observer pattern also allows the view to be decoupled because observers allow events to trigger real time for the user.

## What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
Subscribe, unsubscribe, and broadcast methods

## Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
When the template is generated it prompts for a few user interactions. It asks for the project name, style/project wanted and if the git it to be initialized. These are uniquely triggered based on which response is given by the user.
