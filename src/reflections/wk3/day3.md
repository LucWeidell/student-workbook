# Forms and Templates (Day 3/3)

## What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
The property in the ProxyState to be observed, and the function to trigger.

## What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to insure the value does not become undefined?
For every get function there must be a Return to the function to make sure a value is passed back.

## What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?
Proxy Objects can be passed and viewable to many classes or controllers without compromising the integrity of the original state of the data values contained within..
