# INTRODUCTION TO VUEJS (Day 1/6)

## Reflection:
Honestly this is going to be short. This week was exhausting.
I went a little overboard on trying to keep teh appstate clean during the partner checkpoint, as well
as I followed the figmas too religiously from the weekend and the through the week.
Lesson learned: dont follow the figmas. But it was good work working on the back and front end continuously.
