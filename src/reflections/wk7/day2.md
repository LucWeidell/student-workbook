# CHECKPOINT (Day 1/6)

## What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
Code documentation is the act of placing comment header above pieces of code for clarification.
The major example in JS is Javadocing. This can help specify the type parameters of data even in
a non data defined language. Also can give other developers info on the use case of classes, objects, and functionality.

## What are some benefits of Code Documentation?
Largely readability, code backtracking, data type watching, parameter checking.

## How important is Code documentation and why?
As specified above, it is critical when a application scope grows exponentially to get a faster understanding of what objects can date, or return
and the reason for certain functionality so not everyone needs to re-read the entire code base every time.
