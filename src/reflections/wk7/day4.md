# CHECKPOINT (Day 4/7)

## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
During our project we exclusively  partnered programming except on night of additional single work I did.
This made sure that both of us were on the same page. In addition we transitioned during periods where
we recognized that one person was a better navigator and the other the driver. This made sure we werent too
burned out from coding ourselves.
We also attempted to the best of our ability: child/nested routing, modularity, data grouping, and having a minimal app state.

## What went well?
We were very close to the figma design. We successfully completed with an 100, though while not perfect it was satisfactory.
We stayed mostly within the time parameter. We stuck to the partner programming. We were able to keep using the ideas presented in the class though the week.
There was good communication leading to extremely minimal conflict if there was any at all.

## What would you do differently?
The data design. DICTIONARIES.
Three days in Mark critiqued our data structure as we were doing complex overwriting
of the appstate for each card which was very difficult to keep track of the current data.
Had we been informed before we could have changed the way we stored data for sure.
Besides that not following the figma so hard would have been smart as well.
