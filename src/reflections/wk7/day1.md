# CHECKPOINT INTRODUCTION (Day 1/6)

## What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
Paired Programming is the act of two developers sharing on workstation or setup in the development of code.
The roles are the driver, and the observer, where the driver codes and the navigator directs the driver and the tasks to do.

## What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
Some benefits is that with mutiple sets of eyes debugging and error catching can happen much faster. Typically better designed code
is produced due to the navigator giving best practice advice. It also minimizes burnout because of rotation.

## What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
The draw back can be development speed. This is variable depending on how many roadblocks spitting up
can cause but one setup limits the amount of line produced. There also can be non mutual work sharing.
