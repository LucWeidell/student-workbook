# CHECKPOINT (Day 3/7)

## What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?
The user experience is the process of documenting and reflecting on how a end point user of your
application will navigate and interact with your program. This an also include how different types of user roles will interact.

## What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?
This can give insight on the layout of the client side as well as the necessary functionality that will be required to provide
the wanted user experience. It also can give info on the data structure of the project.

## Why is the User Experience important?
Again as specified above, the program is not designed for the developer but for the user. The better and
smoother the user experience the longer you can retain a user on your website with leads to everything
from positive reviews to increased sales.
