# USING AUTH0 IN VUEJS AND REVUE ADVANCED FRONTEND FRAMEWORKS (Day 3/6)

## What is a nested route?
A nested route is utilizing the router link in order to load a page based about several factors
such as search by the id field. This also allows for authentication and auth checking

## When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)
A nested route could be when loading a profile page the route would look like /profile/:id
this can be expanded further for more information such as /profile/id/aboutMe. This helps make clear
understandable routes for a developer and a user following restFul convention

## Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
Yes, such as above: I may be passing the name: "Profile" to load the page but also pass:
params{id: 'eaeeads'} to specify a specific page
