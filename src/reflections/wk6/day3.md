# SIMULATING MULTIPLE PAGES WITH THE VUE ROUTER (Day3/6)

## What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?
Reactive, computed, onMounted: These are functions that will load or change data given a certain condition,
or the original data changed and it updates. This is good for speedy calculation of data. Low cost and helps simplify data.

## How have you utilized lifcycle hooks in your afternoon projects?
Reactive and computed are lifecycle hooks we have been utilizing. This will actively check the data
it is pointing to just like ProxyState.on. In the case what the data is looking at changes then it will change
accordingly.

## What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
Mounting hooks have been used when we are running onMounted. On the creation of a component
run certain functionality to load certain data that is necessary for the loading of the page
or the component.
