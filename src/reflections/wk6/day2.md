# VUE COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE (Day 2/6)

## What are props?
Props are provisional properties assigned to an object when it is being based around.
This is not stored to the model but can be received by another component this can help
keep track of data when how data is being recieved is not so clear.

## What are props used for?
As explained above, you can add additional parameters which can help keep track of the flow of data
without actually appending is to the model.

## Where can props be used or accessed?
PRops can be used in teh template of components and pages and be read from the component
they were passed to with the props: receiver.
