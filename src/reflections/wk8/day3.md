# CapStones #2  (Day 3/8)

## What is Software Development Testing?
Examples we do:
Manual Testing through loggers and seeing the result.
Postman requests to make sure data populates correctly
The private postman suit we were running

## What are the benefits of Testing in software development?
Can be confident when pushing code especially to production that at this given time the build is stable
and functioning as intended. This also can severely decrease on debugging time if a team is modular about their code.

## What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?
Its development time. This is why automated testing/pipelines as been a huge thing in the industry for
the past 10 years. Where one test can be run again all code without any manual user input or timing/great for computing resources.
Tests can have to be manually run/viewed/created which is less development time
