# Professional Work Reflection (Day 1/8)

## What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
A developer portfolio proves to employers and recruiters you are actively engaging in your industry.
Outside of work hours you are productive and always learning when this career is a lifelong learning
process. Simply that are display pieces to show your expertise.

## What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
This is not sugar coded words or empty promises. A employer sees a historical record of word
you have produced, the frequency, and the results. They could pull down your code and see the quality
you produce.

## What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
With some touchup:
1. Network
2. CapStone: hopefully:
3. I think I can go back and make my moon mine effective in vanial js
4. The itunes playlist
