# Week Reflection (Day 5/8)

## Reflection
Coming into the weekend we pickup a few members last minute which always can be a struggle but I think our team will handle.
My own reflection is I need to be harder as the PO and make the project move, since these discussions,
pull the members away from the work. Feel like we have the time to make this good though
