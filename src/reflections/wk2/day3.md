# INTERACTING WITH THE DOM AND EVENTS (Day3/2)

## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
Writing through the script: console.logs/errors
  -Good for just  printing values at a particular moment without stopping the code
  -print exactly what you choose
Writing on the script inspector
  -After run-time invoking functions and seeing results
  -create variables and see values
Debugger/Breakpoints
  -Create breakpoints so that code pauses at the moment of arrival
  -Great to see many values but more congested: step-through allows one process change results to be viewable

## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
Element Tab

## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
Debugger : line in script:
Breakpoints:
Writing alerts that only print on a fault not every time.
