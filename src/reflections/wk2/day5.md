# End of JS week 2 (Day 5/2)

## Reflections:
Good re overview of how to do functional programming.
There was a taste of OOD but a focus on logic challenges in conjunction with applying it to our web dev.
Also was a good refresher on data structure design and such.
Improvements can always be made on design and coding speed but it was a good de-ruster.
