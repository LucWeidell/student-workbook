# JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS, OBJECTS, AND LOOPS (day 2/2)

## What are the three ways to syntactically write a function?
Declaration, Expressions, and Arrow Expressions

## What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
Expressions are not hoisted also they do not have a {this} value vs normal variable.
Function declarations are hoisted and have a name.

## What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
Parameter: banana word holder to accept an input for function (banana1, banana2)
argument: what is actually passed into a function real time ('my banna', 'this is real banna')

## What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
Functions that either take or return a function.
Ex: forEach(), filter(), find(): each run on an erray and each element adn can have an expression that run
  on each element making it higher order.
