# INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT (Day1/2)

## What is Scope?
Scope is the term used in discussion of the visibility of items in memory throughout a project.
For example a function's scope is only the global variables or variables created at its current or nested levels.

## What is Hoisting ?
Hoisting is the idea of how the computer run through the script and what it compiles before run-time.
For example functions and VARs are hoisted such that they are known to exist but not initialized until utilized. Everything in the document can read these.

## In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
Const: you dont want to lose a object reference or you never want the internal value changed
Let: most universal variable initializer that is non-hoisted
Var: a variable initializer in the case you want it hoisted and its scope increased.
